	- User login

	- Update and distribution running regulary without interaction from the user
	- snort.conf support


			COMMENTS

	- The update script ignores rules that are already commented out in the .rules files. In other words these rules will never be included in the database.
	- The update script uses SID as rule identification. If two rules have the same SID, the rule with the highest REV will be the one kept in the database. 
	- The different sensor folders in the files_to_distribute directory is first created when the distribute.py script have been executed for the first time.
	- All files in the root of the files_to_distribute directory will be distributed to all sensors, while the files in the folders will only be distributed to the respective sensor.
	- The snort.conf file can manually be placed in the correct folder for automatic distribution.  


			PREREQUISITES

			INSTALL

	1. vim config.py 
	2. python install.py

	update.py and distribute.py can be started trough the GUI or manually in the command line. These scripts does NOT run without user interaction, it is therefore
	recommended to configure these two script, by the way of for example cromtab, to be run atleast once a day, to keep rules updated on a regular basis.
